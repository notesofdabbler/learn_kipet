In this folder, I am attempting to recreate parameter estimation examples in the book [Chemical Reactor Analysis and Design - Rawlings and Ekerdt](https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~jbraw/chemreacfun/) using the open source python package [KIPET](https://github.com/salvadorgarciamunoz/kipet). [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) (also open source) is used to solve examples in the book. Authors of the book have created [paresto](https://github.com/rawlings-group/paresto)(a MATLAB/Octave tool based on [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/)) to solve the parameter estimation problems in the book.
